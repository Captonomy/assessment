Dear Candidate,

Thank you for expressing interest in the ML position at Captonomy Consulting. To assess your expertise in machine learning concepts and applications, we have a scenario for you to address. Please note this is a hypothetical scenario, and we're not expecting a detailed technical solution. Instead, we're interested in your high-level approach and strategic thinking. It's important to note that generic or auto-generated responses won't align with our expectations. We seek genuine insights that showcase your understanding and innovative problem-solving abilities.

### Scenario 
Your task is to devise a model capable of extracting structured information from a collection of document images (e.g., invoice, utility-bill, bill-of-lading, tax forms etc). These documents exhibit semi-structured characteristics, wherein predefined fields such as name, amount, address, etc are expected to exist in the document image. The challenge lies in identifying these fields accurately across diverse document layouts. Assume that the image can be converted to textual form, including spatial information, using an OCR engine, yet the quality of the OCR is not always very good (e.g. hard-to-read handwritten info, badly-digited documents, etc).

##### Challenges
- Variability in field positions across images due to diverse document layouts.
- Limited labeled data for training, necessitating robust feature engineering.
- Managing uptraining strategies effectively to fine-tune existing Language Models (LLMs) or build models from scratch for improved performance.
- Mitigating the risks of hallucinations or generating spurious information while ensuring grounding of extracted data to maintain accuracy and reliability.

Your response should detail the challenges inherent in this scenario, focusing on strategies to address uptraining complexities, the decision-making process between utilizing existing LLMs or training from scratch, and methods to prevent model hallucinations while maintaining grounded, reliable extractions.

We're eager to gain insights into your problem-solving strategies and methodology. Your response will be pivotal in assessing your capabilities to address complex ML challenges effectively. Your reply should be approximate 200-300 words.

Loking forward to your insights!
